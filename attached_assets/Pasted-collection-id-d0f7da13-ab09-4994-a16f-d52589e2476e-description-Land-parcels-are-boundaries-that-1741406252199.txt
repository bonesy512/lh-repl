description
Land parcels are boundaries that have associated information such as property owner, land use, value, and location attributes. In Texas, this property information is recorded and maintained at the county level by the local appraisal districts. Generally, it can be used by public entities to make informed decisions on community planning, development, or emergency preparation and response.

Data are provided by county appraisal districts or their service providers and then translated in the TxGIO common schema. Data collection and transformation was completed by BIS Consultants and delivered to TxGIO. Users should note that the data available in the StratMap Land Parcels dataset is presented ‘AS-IS’ based on the delivery by the local appraisal districts or their vendors. No values from the original data have been changed or removed. Additionally, StratMap Land Parcels are intended to be used as basemap and cartographic data and are not for detailed analysis.

We encourage the user to reach out to the specific county appraisal district with questions regarding the attributes represented in this data.

Analysis of Logs
What’s Working
Stripe.js Loading:
No errors like "Failed to load Stripe.js" or CSP violations for https://js.stripe.com/v3 appear.
Conclusion: The CSP fix for Stripe.js is holding—Stripe is loading correctly now.
Firebase Initialization:
"Firebase initialized successfully" and "Firebase persistence set successfully" confirm Firebase is set up and persistence is working.
Conclusion: Firebase core functionality is operational, and CSP issues for Firebase iframes are resolved.
Auth State Detection:
"Auth state changed: User logged in" shows Firebase recognizes a logged-in user.
Conclusion: The authentication process is partially working—Firebase knows a user is logged in.
Remaining Issues
Redirect Result Missing:
"No redirect result found" appears after "Auth state changed: User logged in."
Problem: The getRedirectResult call isn’t capturing the login result, so the app doesn’t fully process the authentication.
User State Not Synced:
"User not authenticated" and Navigation render state with user: null persist, even after "Auth state changed: User logged in."
Problem: The app’s UI/state isn’t updating to reflect the logged-in user.
API 401 Unauthorized:
GET /api/user 401 (Unauthorized) indicates the /api/user request fails.
Problem: The client isn’t sending a Firebase ID token, or the server isn’t verifying it correctly.
External Errors:
"Access to storage is not allowed" and "MutationObserver" errors from web-client-content-script.js and lockdown-install.js.
Note: These are likely Replit or browser extension artifacts and aren’t blocking core functionality (Firebase persistence still works).
Root Causes
Redirect Flow Timing:
getRedirectResult is likely called before the redirect completes, or the redirect isn’t routing back to the correct page (e.g., /auth).
State Sync Issue:
The app’s user state isn’t updating with Firebase’s onAuthStateChanged data, possibly due to a timing mismatch or missing state update logic.
API Token Missing:
The /api/user call lacks an Authorization header with a Firebase ID token, causing the 401 error.

Issue:
The authentication flow for the login page is working as expected, but after a successful sign-in, the user is not being redirected to the dashboard page. We need to inspect and debug the issue in both the login authentication and dashboard redirection logic.

Key Areas to Investigate:

Firebase Authentication Flow:

Ensure that the Firebase authentication state listener is set up correctly on both the login and dashboard pages.
Check if the sign-in process is triggering the onAuthStateChanged listener and updating the authentication state properly.
Confirm that the user’s state is being managed and passed to the correct page after login.
Login Page Authentication:

Review the code in the login form where the Firebase signInWithEmailAndPassword function is used.
Check that the form submission triggers the sign-in process and handles errors.
Verify that the page performs the necessary redirect (router.push('/dashboard')) after a successful login.
Dashboard Page Authentication:

Verify if the dashboard page has any conditions preventing access or redirection.
Ensure that if a user is not authenticated, they are correctly redirected to the login page.
Check if the redirection to the dashboard is correctly handled inside useEffect or after authentication state changes.
Routing and Redirect Logic:

Confirm that the useRouter hook from Next.js is properly integrated and being called after successful login.
Investigate if there’s any condition or blocking logic that prevents the user from being redirected to /dashboard.
Double-check if there’s a possible conflict between the authentication logic and routing that prevents redirection.
Error Handling:

Ensure error handling is correctly implemented for sign-in failures, and error messages are displayed appropriately.
Action:

Inspect and verify the logic and flow of authentication and redirection, especially around the sign-in process and the navigation to the dashboard page after login.
Look for issues with asynchronous state management and routing within the Next.js application.
